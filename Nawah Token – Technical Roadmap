### üîÑ Initial Liquidity Provision and Locking

To ensure a stable and trustworthy launch of Nawah Token (NWTK), an initial liquidity provision will be allocated and deployed on decentralized exchanges, primarily PancakeSwap.

The preliminary price reference is defined as:
- **1 NWTK ‚âà 0.60 USDT**

The first trading pair to be launched:
- **NWTK / USDT** or **NWTK / BNB**

An initial liquidity pool of:
- **100,000 NWTK + 60,000 USDT (or equivalent in BNB)**  
will be locked and made available to the public.

To secure investor trust and market stability:
- **Liquidity will be locked** for a minimum period of 6 months using reputable tools such as **Pinksale** or **Team.Finance**.
- Liquidity management will be handled through a **Multi-Signature Wallet** to ensure governance transparency.
- The contract owner may optionally execute `renounceOwnership()` to further decentralize control after deployment and market stabilization.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Price Volatility and Trading Pairs Stability

When providing liquidity for the trading pair `NWTK / BNB`, it is important to note that BNB's price fluctuates continuously against stablecoins like USDT or BUSD.  
This fluctuation directly affects the relative value of NWTK in terms of BNB, meaning the price of NWTK in BNB can rise or fall depending on BNB's market price.

To reduce the impact of BNB price volatility and provide greater market stability, it is also recommended to add stable trading pairs such as:

- `NWTK / USDT`  
- or `NWTK / BUSD`  

Stablecoins like USDT and BUSD provide a relatively stable price, which helps to:

- Provide a consistent price reference for the token  
- Attract traders who prefer price stability  
- Reduce risks of large market fluctuations  

Thus, combining trading pairs `NWTK / BNB` and `NWTK / BUSD` creates a more stable trading environment and improves long-term token liquidity.

## üöÄ From Token to Native Coin: Nawah Blockchain Roadmap

Nawah Token (NWTK) is currently deployed as a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  
As part of the long-term vision, Nawah plans to transition from a token to a native coin on its own blockchain ‚Äî **NawahChain**.

This transition will involve:

- Building a dedicated blockchain network using technologies such as **BSC Fork**, **Substrate**, or **Cosmos SDK** to ensure scalability, decentralization, and enhanced governance.
- Launching a **Bridge** to allow seamless conversion of existing NWTK tokens to native coins on NawahChain at a fixed ratio (e.g., 1:1).
- Distributing native coins fairly to current token holders, ensuring transparency and community trust.
- Deploying the NawahChain mainnet with support for decentralized governance, NFTs, and Web3 functionalities.
- Gradually phasing out the BEP-20 token contract or freezing its supply to avoid duplication.

This strategic evolution empowers Nawah with full control over its ecosystem, enabling innovative features and stronger community engagement aligned with its vision of cultural empowerment and Web3 inclusion.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Nawah technical roadmap reflects an ambitious vision that goes beyond traditional cryptocurrency models. It builds a bridge between culture, technology, and art through global partnerships, digital creativity, and the decentralized empowerment of emerging voices. Nawah is shaping a new digital civilization driven by imagination and justice.
